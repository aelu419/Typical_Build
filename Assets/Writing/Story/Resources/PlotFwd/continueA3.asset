  text: "<O lamp/>The rain was quite boring, occasional drops broke into the unfinished
    cocoon, and then just left...\r\nThe path was mostly washed off, and so the worm
    never got to meet the rest of the \"ordinary, hardworking insects\".<O lamp/>\r\nA
    bird--feathers damped and heavy--approached the cocoon, took some chances poking
    at it, but couldn't get the worm out. <O npc random/>\r\nSuddenly, a non-sense
    <B>idea</B> flashed <O lamp/> across its water-weighed head, and was immediately
    approved by its decisional facility out of pure boredom.\r\n\"Will you please
    come out,\" asked the bird, completely un-serious.\r\nThe worm had no idea how
    to react, but thanks to an \"equal but opposite\" boredom, it decided to reply:
    \"Why?\"\r\n\"Well, you see, what you're trying to do in this cocoon, I can help
    you do it faster, and better.\"\r\n\"Wait what? <O lamp/> You're gonna help me
    finish building this by... <I>eating me alive</I> That makes no sense at all.\"\r\n\"Oh
    no, I don't mean this cocoon non-sense. I can help you on <I>your transformative
    process</I> in general. See, after you finish building, do you know what exactly
    happens? Like, sure, some <B>flyable thing</B> comes out of it eventually, but
    would that be <B>you</B>? Would it <B>think</B> like you, or <B>feel</B> like
    you?\" <O lamp/>\r\n\"Well, who else could it be?\"\r\n\"I've heard stories,
    my friend. Some say you'll fall asleep and <I>another mind</I> takes over. You'll
    know how to fly the instant you get out, but are you--the worm you--born with
    that knowledge? <O lamp/> Or did anyone teach you to fly? The only explanation
    is: this other spirit, who is born with flight knowledge, replaces yourself.
    You're just dead.\" <O npc random/>\r\n\"Uhh... okay...? Still no reason to get
    <I>out</I>, though.\" <O lamp/>\r\n\"Well, if you come out now, you'll soon become
    <I>part of a flying creature</I>, aka <I>myself</I>: no tiring work wiggling
    for days, no insomnia, no slow, lonely death. I guarantee wholeheartedly (and
    stomachly) that the process will be <I>extremely fast</I>, and, therefore, <I>mostly</I>
    painless. <O lamp/> Besides, this <I>alternative</I> flying creature gets to
    last way longer and fly way higher than some random moth you'll get to be. ...
    Basically: better product, better experience, better efficiency!\"\r"
