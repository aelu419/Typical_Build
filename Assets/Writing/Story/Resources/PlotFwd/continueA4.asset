  text: "What next? <O lamp/> I think that's where I left off last time I rewrote
    this story.\r\n<H>I think I had a version where the worm met some grown moth
    or butterfly, but then the lifecycle thing would make no sense: how could they
    coexist at the same time?\r\nOh God... what do I say next... should've made a
    draft before this...\r\nWould those people hear it? I mean, I think the A4 only
    records relevant lines, so my rambling wouldn't be get in there...\r\nOr not,
    it goes back and some poor inspector-director-guy would have to waste <I>precious
    minutes</I> listening to bullsh*t on birds... talking to worms. </H>\r\nWait,
    isn't my original goal to get back at them? <O lamp/> For letting me wait a week
    for <I>absolutely nothing</I>? <O lamp/> Then it's better to let them hear!\r
    Screw them!\nBut it feels weird that my rambling is heard by... anyone else...<O
    lamp/> feels almost <I>embarracing</I>... Haha, I'm probably punishing myself
    more than getting back at them...<O npc random/>\r\nLet's just ramble on...<O
    lamp/> can we ramble on? <O lamp/> Hmm... \r"
