    it so many times and now I can''t get a hold of it...</H> <O lamp/>

    Oh,
    yeah, right, it starts at afternoon... alright:

    It was a summer afternoon.
    Rain clouds were gathering on the distant horizon, but they weren''t tinted pink
    yet, not with the sun up high. <O lamp/> <O npc random/>

    There was a <B>silkworm</B>
    knitting itself a cocoon. <O lamp/> The worm was absolutely <I>filled</I> with
    chewed leaves, almost to the brink of bursting--the early months of its life
    were just endless binge-eating, afterall. "Now it''s time to put it all to use,
    I guess," it told itself. <O lamp/>

    It dragged the silk to the left, stuck
    it in place, fixed it steady, and started over to the right--then up, and down,
    and left again. <O npc random/>

    There was something of a frame already in
    place, but it looked nothing like a cocoon.

    The worm had been working on
    it for <I>hours</I>, and the initial excitement for starting something life changing
    (literally) was starting to wear off. <O lamp/>

    It felt all the chewed leaves
    tumbling in its stomach, making it <I>nauseated</I>, and the summer heat didn''t
    help at all--the sun was like an overseer, not a motivator... <O lamp/> and the
    repetitive work adds a layer of hypnosis on top of the nausea. <O lamp/>

    As
    the worm drilled the routine <O lamp/> into its subconscious: <I>left, right,
    up, down</I>, it began to lose sight over what''s around it, <O lamp/> shifting
    instead to a sort of "autopilot".
