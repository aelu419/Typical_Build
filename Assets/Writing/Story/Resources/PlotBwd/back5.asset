  text: 'What even is <O npc hostile/> going on? First that letter, then this...
    <I>helmet-can-machine-thing</I>, <O stump/>

    what do they want from me? <O
    stump/>

    Can it see, or hear?

    It''s all a trick isn''t it, just to see
    me make myself look like a dumbass...

    I think I wasn''t even qualified,
    they''re <O npc hostile/> just trolling me with this... <O stump/>

    Let me
    read the letter again, <O npc hostile/> just to see if I misread anything
