  text: "<O lamp/> The ant was like someone with a slightly morbid obsession over
    wearing uniforms and waking up early. <O lamp/>\r\nApparently, on that day, the
    worm was building its cocoon over the ant's path, which was carefully marked
    with scent so the other ants could follow by tracing, all the way to some insect
    corpse up on the canopy, waiting to be taken apart and fed to the larvae. <O
    lamp/>\r\nThe rainclouds have gathered to a sheet that somewhat blocked the sun.
    Although the cocoon was in already shielded by the canopy, an extra bit of coolness
    doesn't harm.\r <O lamp/>\nIt was then that the ant approached and formally complained
    about the blockage.\r <O lamp/>\nThe worm didn't really hear it, though, since
    it was still on autopilot--it kept on working, and working, and working.\r <O
    lamp/>\nEventually, the ant grew grumbly and ditched its professional mannerisms,
    stepping right through one of the larger holes (the cocoon was still quite sparse
    at the time) and shouted, \r\n\"Can you please get your fat ass off the way!
    \r<O lamp/>\nCan't you see that ordinary, hardworking insects like me are using
    this path? <O lamp/>\r\nAnd you just lay here like it's all just <B>nothing</B>?\r
    <O lamp/>\nHow much effort do you think I put into this--<I>hell</I>, do you
    even know what effort is? <O lamp/> Have you worked a <B>day</B> of your life?
    You just know how to eat, and eat, and when you stop eating you just cause <B>trouble</B>!\"
    <O lamp/><O npc random/><O lamp/><O lamp/>\nBy the time the worm shifted off
    of auto pilot, it noticed a bite mark on its stomach (maybe that's what caused
    it to wake up in the first place).\r\nThe ant was gone, frustrated, worm-goo
    dripping off its teeth. <O lamp/>\r\n"
