  input: 'To be, or not to be, that is the question:

    Whether ''tis nobler in
    the mind to suffer

    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

    Or
    to take arms against a sea of troubles

    And by opposing end them?

    To
    die: to sleep;

    No more; and, by a sleep to say we end

    The heart-ache
    and the thousand natural shocks

    That flesh is heir to, ''tis a consummation

    Devoutly
    to be wish''d. To die, to sleep;

    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there''s
    the rub;

    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

    When we have
    shuffled off this mortal coil,

    Must give us pause.'
