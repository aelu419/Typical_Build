  text: "<O lamp/> Yesterday was so weird. Why would the thing start moving all of
    a sudden?\r <O lamp/>\nDid it hear what I was saying?\r\n<H>But shouldn't it
    only react to the actual story?</H> And when I went back to practicing, I think
    I heard it moving while I spoke. <O npc random/>\r\nLet me try again... <O lamp/>
    see if it still reacts... I think this is where I left off yesterday:\r\nThe
    old rat caught sight of young Arthur, who wasn't in the line, and wasn't exactly
    outside it. <O lamp/> He stood just nearby, hesitating. \"You are coming too,
    aren't you?\" Asked the old rat. \"I don't know,\" said Arthur calmly, \"I'm
    not certain, the roof may not fall down yet.\" ...\r <O lamp/>\nHere it is again!
    That sound! And it's moving again, how perfectly un-strange! Damn it, why...
    what... why? Does it not care about what I say? <O npc random/>\r\nIt's almost
    deadline right, or is it deadline already? Is it returning to The Company?\r
    <O lamp/>\nBut I haven't even started yet!\n...\nWhat to DO...\n... <O lamp/>\nThey
    can't just...\nI mean-- Um... Uh...\n<H>What should I do?? It's not giving me
    any chance isn't it... Like it's... ... ... </H> \r\nOh... <O lamp/> I know what
    to do, I've got this PERFECT story I've been wanting to tell <I>all this time</I>,
    and since they're not giving me the script, I'll read <I>that</I> instead! They'll
    <I>love</I> <O lamp/> it so much, just like what I feel for their non-existent
    <I>masterpiece</I>"
