  text: "Due to recent circumstances, we have been developing a new mode of work
    to engage talented individuals like you in our creative process. \r<O lamp/>\nInstead
    of auditioning, casting, and recording your performances face to face, the new
    work flow would be fully remote, utilizing our state of the arts technologies.\r
    <O lamp/>\nAlong with the script itself, you will receive an <B>automatic audiomotive
    augmented audience</B> (short as A4)\u2014<O lamp/> one of our newest inventions\u2014that
    records your performance and provides live feedback.\r <O lamp/>\nInstead of
    performing short segments for casting, you will narrate the entire script to
    the A4 in the span of a week. <O npc random/>\r<O lamp/>\nThen, we will pick
    favorable segments of your performance and mix it into the final product.\r<O
    lamp/>\nRest assured, you will have more than one attempt at recording this,
    so no need to be nervous. <O lamp/>The A4 will autonomously return to us at deadline--before
    that, you can take as many attempts as you want to.\r<O lamp/>\nThank you for
    your enthusiasm, and we look forward to \"hearing\" back from you!\r\n"
