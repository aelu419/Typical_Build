  text: '<O lamp/> I wonder if someone will steal it if it stays outside the door
    like this. <O lamp/> It''s been days and it''s still standing there.

    But
    again, everyone''s shut in nowadays, I guess the thieves have <B>hygiene</B>
    as well. <O lamp/>

    Should I let it in? <H>Does it even know how to get in?</H>

    I
    guess I''ll just <O lamp/> wait some more, then. <O npc random/>

    Well, okay,
    not just waiting, I can do some practice. Let''s see... there''s this pronunciation
    thing I learned back then, I think I still remember it:

    Once upon a time,
    there was a young rat named Arthur who couldn''t make up his mind. <O lamp/>

    Whenever
    the other rats asked him if he would go out with them, he would say, "I don''t
    know."

    And when they said, "Would you rather stay inside?" <O lamp/>

    He
    wouldn''t say yes or no either. He never wanted to make a choice. <H>Hmm... this
    reads awfully like what we''re in right now... </H>

    One fine day, <O lamp/>
    his aunt appealed to him... <O npc random/>

    <H>Did it make a noise? (the
    A4, I mean, not the aunt) I think I heard something, some metallic sound. Let
    me check outside...</H> <O lamp/>

    Huh... it''s... moving...? I can''t tell
    what gesture it''s making--looks like it''s... happy? <O lamp/> Excited? Agitated?
    I remember they said it''ll give me feedback--is this what they were talking
    about?
