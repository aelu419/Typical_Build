    script: 'Hi!

      I''m here to guide you through the tutorial!

      Now,
      this game isn''t made for torturing your fingers...

      Well, at least not
      primarily.

      You can progress as long as you type the right letter

      Capitalization,
      punctuation, and spacing can be ignored completely!

      You can also go
      back using BACKSPACE,

      Although I''m not sure why there''s such a feature

      I
      mean... who wants to un-play a game?'

    script: 'You may already know that SPACE toggles your light

      Or not! And
      that''s totally fine :)

      You can use it to reveal hidden text

      If
      you can''t see the road ahead, use the light!'

    script: 'ESC pauses the game

      And that''s all of the normal controls

      Now,
      the game may glitch and you may get stuck,

      We hope this doesn''t happen,
      but just in case...

      Try to save and reload if that happens.'
