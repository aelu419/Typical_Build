  text: "Dear customer,\r\nWe want you to know that The Company always strives for
    the best quality for its products.\r\nBut sadly, due to the recent pandemic impacting
    our work environment, the quality of <B>Typical</B> has yet to match the standards
    we deem to be <I>presentable</I> to the wider audience.\r\nInstead of speeding
    through the production process, we have decided to delay the release of the game
    until later this year.\r\nAgain, thank you so much for your interest in our creative
    endeavors, and we sincerely apologize for the delay.\r\n... As an alternative,
    we have decided to give you one month of free trial for our newest, experimental,
    endless narration service.\r\nThis new service fuses creativity with the endless
    power of computation using our newly developed, <B>automated narrator</B> ...
    (the ad speech goes on until the terms and conditions began, which, of course,
    will be skipped) ... \r\n"
